# Getting Started - quick start

The project is built on a React front end, and a node.js server.

Client:
https://github.com/JaimiiGrindhouse/james-simmonds-capstone-walc-r-client

Clone this repository.

The .env will require you to have a https://www.mapbox.com/Apikey, it needs to be in the following format.

REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=Your mapbox api key here (be mindful your api key is not in a string)

Server:
https://github.com/JaimiiGrindhouse/james-simmonds-capstone-walc-r-api

You will need to clone this repository from Github also.

Both projects will start with the command npm start in you IDE terminal.

The .env in the server will require an api key for https://openweathermap.org/ in the following format:

OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY="Your Api key here"

(be mindful, your api key does need to be in a string for this.)
